✅ PHASE 2 CHECKLIST: ML & Data Lake (Weeks 15-18)
🗄️ WEEK 15: Data Lake Setup
Goal: S3 bucket with 3 years of historical data

 Choose Storage Provider
 Option A: AWS S3 (standard, widely known)
 Option B: Cloudflare R2 (cheaper, 10GB free)
 Decision: [Record your choice and why]
 Sign up for chosen provider
 Create Storage Structure
 Create bucket/namespace: stockpulse-data-lake
 Create folders:
/bronze/stocks/date=YYYY-MM-DD/
/silver/processed/date=YYYY-MM-DD/
/gold/features/date=YYYY-MM-DD/
/models/
 Configure access keys
 Add keys to .env file (never commit!)
 Install Libraries
 Install: boto3 (for S3/R2 access)
 Install: pyarrow (for Parquet files)
 Test: can upload and download a test file
 Backfill Historical Data
 Fetch 3 years of historical data
 Strategy: Monthly snapshots (36 total)
 For each month:
Fetch ~500 stocks data for that date
Save raw JSON to bronze layer
~500 stocks × 36 months = 18,000 data points
 This will take several hours - run overnight
 Handle API rate limits carefully
 Verify Data
 Check file counts (should have ~36 months of data)
 Check file sizes (should be reasonable)
 Spot check: download and inspect random files
 Calculate total storage used (~2-5 GB estimated)
 Document Data Lake
 Create docs/DATA_LAKE.md
 Explain folder structure
 Document naming conventions
 Explain bronze/silver/gold pattern
 Note: why we need historical data (for ML training)
Week 15 Deliverable: ✅ Data lake with 3 years of S&P 500 history

    ├── train_model.py
    ├── evaluate_model.py
    ├── explain.py
    └── config.yaml
 Define Features
 List all features to calculate (~40 total):
Fundamental: P/E, P/B, ROE, ROIC, margins, growth rates
Technical: RSI, MACD, moving averages, volume trends
Derived: Rule-based factor scores, sector ranks
Temporal: Month, quarter, days since earnings
 Document in ml/config.yaml
 Note: NO future data in features!
 Implement Feature Engineering
 Create feature_engineering.py
 Function: calculate_all_features(stock_data, date)
 Calculate fundamental features
 Calculate technical indicators (use TA-Lib or pandas)
 Calculate derived features
 Return: feature vector (1 row, 40+ columns)
 Define Prediction Target
 Target: 3-month forward return
 Formula: (price_90_days_later - price_today) / price_today
 Handle: stocks delisted during period (survivorship bias)
 Cap extreme values (±100% max)
 Build Training Dataset
 Create build_training_data.py
 For each historical date in data lake:
Get features at time T
Get actual return from T to T+90 days
Create training example
 Result: ~18,000 examples
 Save as Parquet to /gold/training_data.parquet
 Exploratory Data Analysis
 Create notebook: notebooks/02_ml_eda.ipynb
 Load training data
 Check distributions of features
 Check correlations with target
 Visualize: feature vs return scatter plots
 Check for data leakage (future info in features)
 Identify most predictive features
 Train/Test Split
 Split chronologically (time-series!)
 Train: oldest 70% (~12,600 examples)
 Validation: next 15% (~2,700 examples)
 Test: most recent 15% (~2,700 examples)
 NEVER shuffle (would create look-ahead bias!)
Week 16 Deliverable: ✅ Training dataset with 18,000 examples, 40 features

Data Flow: Two Scoring Paths
Path 1: Rule-Based Scoring

APIs → Bronze → Silver → Score Calculation → Gold (stock_scores)
                                           → API → Frontend
Path 2: ML-Based Scoring

APIs → Bronze → Silver → Feature Engineering → Gold (features)
                                             → Model Training
                                             → Saved Model
                                             
Weekly: Saved Model + Current Features → ML Predictions → Gold (ml_predictions)
                                                        → SHAP Values
                                                        → API → Frontend
Path 3: Hybrid Scoring

Rule Scores + ML Scores → Weighted Average → Gold (hybrid_scores)
                                           → API → Frontend
📊 SCORING SYSTEMS EXPLAINED
System 1: Rule-Based Scoring (Weeks 1-14)
Philosophy: Use proven financial ratios and comparisons

Five Factors (20% weight each):

Value Score
Measures: How cheap is the stock?
Metrics: P/E, P/B, P/S ratios
Comparison: vs sector median
High score: Trading below peers (potentially undervalued)
Growth Score
Measures: Is the company growing?
Metrics: Revenue growth YoY, Earnings growth YoY
Comparison: vs sector peers
High score: Faster growth than competitors
Profitability Score
Measures: How efficiently does it make money?
Metrics: Profit margin, ROE, ROIC
Comparison: vs sector peers
High score: Strong profit conversion
Momentum Score
Measures: Is the stock performing well recently?
Metrics: 3-month return, 6-month return
Comparison: vs sector peers and market
High score: Positive recent price action
Quality Score
Measures: Financial health and stability
Metrics: Debt-to-equity, current ratio, free cash flow
Comparison: vs sector peers
High score: Strong balance sheet
Final Score: Weighted average of 5 factors (0-100 scale)

Strengths:

✅ Explainable (clear why each stock scores high/low)
✅ Deterministic (same inputs = same outputs)
✅ Based on proven investment principles
✅ Easy to understand for users
Limitations:

❌ Doesn't learn from patterns
❌ Equal weights may not be optimal
❌ Can't adapt to changing market conditions
System 2: ML-Based Scoring (Weeks 15-18)
Philosophy: Learn which features actually predict future returns

Model: XGBoost Regressor

Prediction Target: 3-month forward return

Features (40+ total):

All 5 rule-based factors
Additional fundamentals (30+ ratios)
Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages)
Temporal features (month, quarter, days since earnings)
Derived features (sector ranks, market cap tier)
Training:

3 years of historical data
~18,000 training examples
Time-series cross-validation
Optimized for Sharpe ratio
Output:

Predicted 3-month return (e.g., +15%)
Converted to 0-100 score for ranking
SHAP values explaining each prediction
Strengths:

✅ Learns complex patterns from data
✅ Can find non-obvious relationships
✅ Adapts to what actually works historically
✅ Still explainable via SHAP
Limitations:

❌ More complex to implement
❌ Requires historical data and retraining
❌ Can overfit if not careful
❌ Past patterns may not repeat
System 3: Hybrid Scoring (Week 18)
Philosophy: Combine human judgment with machine learning

Formula:

Hybrid Score = (0.5 × Rule Score) + (0.5 × ML Score)
Rationale:

Rules provide stability and explainability
ML provides pattern recognition and adaptability
Combination is often more robust than either alone
Benefits:

✅ More robust to market changes
✅ Reduces overfitting risk
✅ Still highly explainable
✅ Can adjust weights based on confidence

🎤 INTERVIEW PREPARATION GUIDE
30-Second Elevator Pitch
"I built StockPulse to demonstrate my data engineering and machine learning skills. It's a full-stack platform that analyzes 500 stocks weekly using both rule-based scoring and an XGBoost model. The system features a data lake with bronze/silver/gold layers, ML predictions with SHAP explanations, and a modern Next.js dashboard. In backtesting, the hybrid approach achieved a Sharpe ratio of [X], outperforming the S&P 500 by [Y]%."

5-Minute Technical Deep Dive
Start with the problem: "I wanted to help long-term investors identify quality stocks systematically, while demonstrating production-grade data engineering and ML skills."

Explain the architecture: "I implemented a medallion architecture with three layers:

Bronze: Raw API data stored as JSON in S3
Silver: Cleaned, normalized data in Parquet and PostgreSQL
Gold: Final scores and predictions ready for serving
The system has two parallel scoring paths: rule-based factors and an XGBoost model."

Highlight technical challenges: "The hardest part was preventing look-ahead bias in the ML model. I had to carefully construct training examples using only information available at prediction time, with proper time-series cross-validation."

Show the results: "The hybrid approach combines human judgment with machine learning. Users can toggle between scoring methods and see SHAP explanations for why each stock ranks high."

Common Interview Questions & Answers
Q: Why did you build this? A: "Three reasons: demonstrate data engineering skills for job applications, learn about financial markets and ML, and create something I'd actually use for research if it works well. I'm genuinely interested in AI and quantitative finance."

Q: Why XGBoost over neural networks? A: "For tabular data like financial metrics, XGBoost typically outperforms neural networks with much less complexity. It handles missing values well, trains quickly, and is naturally explainable through SHAP values. Plus it's industry-standard at quant firms."

Q: How do you prevent overfitting? A: "Several ways: time-series cross-validation (never train on future data), limited tree depth, regularization, and held-out test set from the most recent period. I also validate that feature importance makes financial sense."

Q: What's the difference between your data lake and warehouse? A: "The lake stores everything in raw and processed formats (S3/Parquet) - optimized for cheap storage and ML training. The warehouse (PostgreSQL) stores only aggregated, ready-to-serve data - optimized for fast API queries. This separation is standard in modern data architectures."

Q: How would you scale this to 10,000 stocks? A: "I'd move to distributed processing with Spark or Dask for the ETL pipeline, add Redis for caching, partition the database by sector, and potentially move to Redshift or BigQuery for analytics. The architecture supports this - it's designed modularly."

Q: What would you do differently if you rebuilt it? A: "I'd start with the data lake from day one instead of adding it later. I'd also add comprehensive logging and monitoring earlier - I added those when debugging production issues. And I'd write more tests upfront."

Q: How accurate are your predictions? A: "The model shows promising backtest results with a Sharpe ratio of [X], but I'm careful to emphasize this is for demonstration. Real alpha is hard - if it were this easy, everyone would do it. That said, the techniques I used are the same ones actual quant firms use."

Q: Can I use this to invest real money? A: "I wouldn't recommend it without extensive additional validation. This is an educational project. That said, the scoring logic is sound and based on proven investment principles, so it's useful for research and learning."

💡 TIPS FOR WORKING WITH AI ASSISTANTS (RooCode)
Getting the Most from RooCode
1. Start each session with context:

@AI_ROLE.md @PROJECT_PLAN.md 
I'm working on Week [N] - [Feature Name]
Current status: [What's done]
Goal: [What I want to accomplish today]
2. Be specific about what you need:

❌ BAD: "Help me with the API"
✅ GOOD: "I need to implement the GET /api/rankings endpoint. 
It should query stock_scores table, filter by date, sort by score, 
and return top N results as JSON. Looking at Week 9 checklist."
3. Ask for explanations, not just code:

"Before showing code, explain:
1. What database tables I'll need to query
2. What the query logic should be
3. What the response schema should look like
Then show me the implementation."
4. Request incremental steps:

"Let's break this into steps:
Step 1: Just get the basic query working
Step 2: Add filtering by date
Step 3: Add pagination
Test after each step."
5. Use project files as reference:

"According to docs/database_schema.md, the stock_scores table has..."
"Following the architecture in PROJECT_PLAN.md, I need to..."
"Based on the scoring methodology in docs/scoring_methodology.md..."
Common Patterns

🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
Common Issues & Solutions
Issue: ETL pipeline fails

Symptoms: No new data, "Last updated" is old
Check:
1. Railway logs for errors
2. API rate limits (yfinance, Alpha Vantage)
3. Database connection
4. Disk space

Solution:
- If rate limited: Wait 24 hours, retry
- If DB connection: Check Railway status page
- If timeout: Increase timeout in code
Issue: API returns 500 errors

Symptoms: Frontend shows "Error loading data"
Check:
1. Railway backend logs
2. Database connectivity
3. Recent schema changes

Solution:
- Check error message in logs
- Test query in database directly
- Rollback if recent deploy broke it
Issue: ML predictions seem wrong

Symptoms: Nonsensical stock picks
Check:
1. Model version deployed
2. Features calculation
3. SHAP values (do they make sense?)
4. Training data date range

Solution:
- Verify model loaded correctly
- Re-run feature engineering
- Check for data drift
- Retrain model if needed
Issue: Frontend not updating

Symptoms: Shows old data even after ETL ran
Check:
1. API returns new data (test with curl)
2. Browser cache
3. Vercel deployment status

Solution:
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check API directly
- Redeploy frontend if needed
